+++

Using Nixxer in tandem with a network blocker ensures that common analytics packages are blocked regardless of where they are hosted or how they're masked. And Nixxer makes it easy to work with common tools.

Exported blocklists contain only third-party tracking domains (like google-analytics.com, facebook.com/tr) detected during browsing. Self-hosted analytics are blocked at the browser level and don't appear in exports, ensuring legitimate website domains are never accidentally blocked at the network level.

**Network Blocker Workflow**

1. Configure Nixxer with desired detection settings.
2. Browse normally for several days to build domain list.
3. Export data using Pi-hole format when threshold reached.
4. Import to your network blocker of choice.
5. Update regularly as new trackers are detected.

##### Network Blocker Setup Instructions

**Pi-hole Setup**

1. Export blocklist in Pi-hole format.
2. Upload to your Pi-hole admin interface:
   - Go to Group Management → Adlists
   - Add the exported file URL or paste content
   - Update gravity: pihole -g

More info is available within [Pi-hole Gravity documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/pihole-command/#gravity).

**NextDNS Setup**

1. Export in NextDNS format.
2. Log into NextDNS dashboard.
3. Go to Denylist → Import.
4. Upload the JSON file

**AdGuard DNS Setup**

1. Export in AdGuard format.
2. Access AdGuard Home admin panel.
3. Go to Filters → DNS blocklists.
4. Add custom list and paste content

For more info read the [AdGuard DNS blocklist documentation](https://adguard-dns.io/kb/private-dns/setting-up-filtering/blocklists/).

**Manual Hosts File**

1. Export in hosts format.
2. Append content to your system hosts file:
   - Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
   - macOS/Linux: /etc/hosts
