### Privacy Principles

#### Data Minimization

- Only tracking domains and detection methods stored
- No user browsing history collected
- No personal information processed
- No external data transmission

#### Local Processing

- All detection happens locally in browser
- No cloud services or external APIs
- Storage limited to browser's local storage
- User controls all data export

#### Transparency

- Open source detection methods
- Clear distinction between tracking types
- User visibility into all detected domains
- Explicit consent for data export

### Security Features

#### Input Validation

- All user settings validated and sanitized
- Domain names checked for validity
- File uploads limited and verified
- Import data thoroughly validated

#### Error Boundaries

- Comprehensive error handling prevents crashes
- Sensitive data excluded from error logs
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- User notification for security-relevant errors

#### Permission Model

- Minimal required permissions requested
- No access to user personal data
- No cross-origin data sharing
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Threat Model

#### Potential Risks

1. **False Positives**: Blocking legitimate functionality
2. **Storage Exhaustion**: Unlimited domain accumulation
3. **Performance Impact**: CPU/memory consumption
4. **Privacy Leaks**: Accidental data exposure

#### Mitigations

1. **Smart Classification**: Distinguish tracking vs content domains
2. **Storage Limits**: Configurable limits with auto-cleanup
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and throttling
4. **Data Isolation**: No external transmission, local-only processing

### Compliance Considerations

#### GDPR Compatibility

- No personal data processing
- User control over all stored data
- Right to deletion (clear data feature)
- Transparent operation

#### Browser Policies

- Follows Firefox extension guidelines
- Respects Content Security Policy
