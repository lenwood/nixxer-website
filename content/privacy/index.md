# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 7 July 2025  
**Last Updated:** 7 July 2025

## Our Privacy Commitment

At Nixxer, privacy isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's our foundation. We built Nixxer specifically to protect your privacy by blocking web tracking, and we apply these same principles to how we handle your data. This policy explains our privacy practices for both the Nixxer browser extension and our supporting website.

**The Bottom Line:** We currently collect no personal data, transmit no information to our servers, and store everything locally on your device under your complete control.

## What This Policy Covers

This privacy policy applies to:

- The Nixxer browser extension
- The Nixxer website hosted at www.nixxer.io via GitHub Pages
- Any future services we may offer (with separate consent required)

## Information We Collect

### Current Data Collection: None

**Browser Extension:**

- We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- We do not track your browsing activity
- We do not send any data to external servers
- All tracking detection and blocking happens entirely on your device

**Website:**

- We do not use analytics packages
- We do not set tracking cookies
- We do not collect visitor information
- We do not store any data about your visits

### Local Data Storage (Browser Extension Only)

The Nixxer extension stores the following information locally in your browser's storage:

**Tracking Domain Database:**

- List of detected tracking domains encountered during your browsing
- Frequency counters for blocked tracking attempts
- Timestamp information for when domains were first detected

**User Preferences:**

- Extension settings and configuration options
- Blocklist format preferences
- Display preferences for statistics

**Important Notes About Local Storage:**

- All data remains on your device and never leaves your browser
- You have complete control over this data
- You can clear this data at any time through your browser settings
- No other applications or services can access this data without your explicit permission

## How We Use Information

Since we don't collect external data, there's no traditional "data use" to describe. However, here's how the extension works:

**Local Processing:**

- The extension analyzes web requests locally to identify tracking attempts
- Statistics are calculated and stored locally for your reference
- Blocklists are generated locally based on your browsing patterns

**Export Functionality:**

- When you choose to export data, the extension packages your locally stored information
- Exports are generated on your device and saved to your chosen location
- We never see or receive copies of your exported data

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

**Current Practice:** We share no data because we collect no data.

**Third-Party Services:**

- GitHub Pages: Our website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may collect basic server logs as part of their service
- Browser APIs: The extension uses standard browser APIs but only for local processing

**Legal Disclosure:**

- Since we don't collect data, there's nothing to disclose
- We will update our privacy page if our privacy practices ever change

## Your Data Rights and Control

**Complete Control:**

- You own all data generated by the extension
- You can export your data in multiple formats (Pi-hole, NextDNS, hosts file, AdGuard)
- You can delete all extension data by removing the extension or clearing browser storage

**No Account Required:**

- No registration or account creation needed
- No password or personal information required
- You remain anonymous while using our services

## Third-Party Services

**GitHub Pages:**

- Our website is hosted on GitHub Pages, a service provided by GitHub, Inc.
- GitHub may collect basic server logs as part of their hosting service
- We recommend reviewing GitHub's privacy policy for their data practices
- We chose GitHub Pages specifically because it's a static hosting service with minimal data collection

**Browser Storage:**

- The extension uses your browser's local storage APIs
- This data is subject to your browser's privacy controls
- Different browsers have different policies for local storage

## Cookies and Tracking

**Our Practices:**

- We do not use cookies on our website
- We do not use any tracking technologies
- We do not participate in cross-site tracking

**Third-Party Cookies:**

- GitHub Pages may use minimal cookies for their hosting service
- Your browser extension blocks tracking from other websites as designed

## Future Services and Changes

**Premium Services:**

- We may offer optional premium services in the future, such as curated blocklist distribution
- Any premium service would require explicit opt-in and separate consent
- We would never change our privacy practices for existing free services without clear notice

**Data Collection Changes:**

- Any future data collection would be clearly disclosed in advance
- We would require explicit user consent before implementing any data collection
- Users would have the option to continue using existing services without new data collection

**Policy Updates:**

- We will provide 30 days' notice before any material changes to this policy

- Continued use after notice period constitutes acceptance of changes

## Data Security

**Local Security:**

- Data stored locally is subject to your device's security measures

**No Server Security Issues:**

- Since we don't store data on servers, there's no risk of server-side data breaches
- Your data cannot be compromised through our systems because it never reaches our systems

## International Users

**Data Location:**

- All data processing happens locally on your device
- No data crosses international borders through our services
- GitHub Pages may have international server locations for website hosting

**Legal Compliance:**

- We are committed to respecting privacy laws in all jurisdictions

- We will comply with applicable laws if we ever change our data practices
